(1) Nerve agents. One
of the better-known
nerve agents is sarin.
These agents attack
the central nervous
system and can
incapacitate and/or
kill.

(2) Vesicants. The
most familiar of these
is mustard, often
referred to as mustard
gas. The vesicants are
so named because,
among other
unpleasant results,
they cause blistering of
the skin.

(3) Lung-damaging
agents. Most
prominent among
these is phosgene,
which is a major
industrial chemical
used to make
chemicals and
pesticides. At room
temperature it is a
poisonous gas.

(4) Cyanide. This is a
highly lethal agent but
one that is not always
well suited to terrorist
use because it
dissipates quickly.
